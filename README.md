# Typescript-JavaScript-Angular-Ionic-News-Weather-Reader-from-JSON-blob
This Mobile Application written in Typescript in Angular and Ionic reads news and weather data from a JSON blob, for a user-specified City anywhere in the world.

To launch the programme, the SRC folder must be added to the directory of an already existing IONIC project. To run the programme,
navigate to that directory with node.js command prompt and run the command:

--ionic serve.
